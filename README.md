# Lab 2 - Playing With Genetic Drift
Let's extend our simulation of random mutations (Lab 1) to study genetic drift. 

## What is genetic drift?
Genetic drift is the name for evolution due to the stochastic change in genotype frequencies in non-infinite populations. Sometimes people refer to it as sampling error, but I disagree with that statement for an overly pedantic philosophical reason. So, feel free to think of it as sampling error if that helps! 

## Why is it interesting?
Seriously, for sooo many reasons! How do we know if the increase of a particular genotype is due to adaptation? Well, we need account for the possibility of drift. 

Remember when we were talking about Sewall Wright and how populations might be able to escape local optima when the populations are small? That's genetic drift in action! 

There's many more, and if anyone thinks of something that needs to be here, let me know! 

## What do I have to do?
Since last time the Jupyter notebooks weren't previewing in GitHub, I'm going to add PDFs instead. Make sure to look through those before going into Repl.it for the lab. 

Then, explore these two effects with your simulation! Make sure you do many replicates, and make plots showing the dynamics of all the populations (on the same graph). Feel free to get creative with your graphs! 

### Population Size Effects
1. You should play with the simulation to see how population size affects the time for a mutation to ***fix*** or go extinct in the population (i.e., reach 100% or 0% frequency). 

### Mutation Frequency Effects
2. You should build an intuition for how the initial frequency of a mutation in the population affects the chance it fixes (rather than goes extinct).

If you're breezing through this, try bringing back mutations and see how that changes the dynamics (e.g., high mutation rate vs low mutation rate).
